# Path-of-Exile-Labyrinth-Overlay

Alt tabbing too much because youre forgetting where the fuck you need to go?

This will draw an overlay of the file "lab.png" that YOU have to manually update with the image every day when you need to (cut the same part i did from poelab.com images)

Opacity is not changage unless you change it in the sauce.

Image size is the Windows Form Size

Only draws when path of exile is open AND the main active window
